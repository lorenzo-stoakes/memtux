# memtux

memtux is intended to be an experimental playground for the linux memory
management subsystem consisting of both experiments with the kernel and userland
code.


This is a playground where I can experiment with ideas and concepts while
writing the [mm book](https://github.com/lorenzo-stoakes/mm-book).
